      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a third year Psychological Science major at Illinois Institute of
        Technology with an interest in Computer Science and ITM. I was recruited
        by the head coach of the women’s soccer team to play and continue my
        education. I am originally from San Diego county in California. I grew up
        in a town called Encinitas and within that a community called Leucadia.
        It’s a beautiful coastal town that has a lot of sunshine, beaches, and
        tourist. The reason I came all the way out to Chicago was to experience
        diversity and to begin my journey through life in a new fantastic city
        where I could get the most out of my college years. By that I mean learn
        to do things on my own, meet new people, and simply discover who I want
        to be and what I want to do. It was definitely a drastic change moving to
        the midwest but at the same time its been an adventure. My first winter
        i’ve ever experienced was a polar vortex! it was scary at the time but now
        it’s just a crazy memory of my first winter in Chicago. Not many
        people where im from can say that. I’ve been so happy here for the last
        three years and can’t wait to keep my journey going. Finally, a huge part
        of my life is my family so I decided to dedicate a full paragraph below
        for them.

      <h3>About my family</h3>
      <p>
        I have a very supportive family, my dad Noren is my number one fan when
        it comes to soccer and life in general. He’s the one that pushed me to
        venture out of California for school beacuse he knew it would be best for
        me. My mom Lisa lives in Humboldt County which is very nothern California
        and she is a beautiful and adventurous woman who I’m convinced has
        absolutely no fears. She picked up her life and moved completely off the
        grid and is now building her own cabin on her property out in the red
        woods. My older sister Rachel just graduated from Humboldt State and is
        now living in the area just enjoying life and looking for jobs. She’s a
        wonderfully talented artist who has always been a great role model for
        me. My grandmother Haruye, my dads mom, has also lived with me and my dad
        for the last 7 years. She is now 97 with dimentia so my dad decided to
        take care of her because he knows she wouldn't have liked living in an
        assited living home. She and my grandfather, Takamoto, were both at Tule
        Lake internment camp and thats where they met. When I was little she
        would always tell me stories about her and grandpa meeting and now that
        she cant rememeber them I get to tell her all about it. Now onto my fury
        legged family, my mom has two dogs Remi and Bailey who my mom calls
        my "brother" and "sister". Remi is a blue heeler and Bailey is a pitbull
        lab mix. My dad is currently taking care of my cat Macey while im away at
        school. He originally wasnt looking forward to it but now he and Macey
        are best friends.
