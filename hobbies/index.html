        <h4>Soccer</h4>
        <p>
          I started playing soccer when I was in elemntary school and instantly
          knew it was something I was going to stick with for as long as I
          could. Its the only time I will ever enjoy running and other physical
          activity. When I was young I also saw how happy it made my dad to
          watch me make friends and sometimes push other girls over. When I
          started playing it also made my mom super excited she got this bumper
          sticker "not your average soccer mom" and put it on the trunk of her
          mini van. Ever since I was little I used it as a release and knew it
          was a way to get adrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine all coursing
          through my body. Even now a complete 12 years later and I still use it
          as a cathartic release. Although now that im in college still playing
          competatively its more than just a hobbie to me. This pandemic has
          cancelled our regular season so its been extremely hard for all of us
          because we should practicing every day, having three games every week,
          and traveling hours away together but instead we barely get any time
          on the field in groups of 4. It’s been hard but I know I would take an
          hour on the field with a couple girls over nothing at all everytime.
          This sport has introduced me to some of my best friends and has really
          shaped me to who I am today.

        <h4>Surfing</h4>
        <p>
          Being from a coastal town surfing was just a part of growing up and it
          has made me feel extrememly blessed because I had that opportunity. My
          father went to San Diego State University simply so he could contnue
          surfing and now he is turning 69 still waking up every morning at 5 am
          to surf with his buddies and he loves every bit of it. He use to
          manage a surf shop called “Doyle Sports,” he ran it with his business
          partner Mike Doyle. Since surfing was so huge in his life he obviously
          had to teach me and my sister how to surf and love every part of it.
          He would push us into waves on our foam wavestorm boards and when we
          would fall off he’d make sure to reassure us and say it happens to
          everyone even the professionals so we shouldn’t be discouraged to stop
          just because were afraid of wipping out. I’ve continued surfing during
          the summer with friends and alone because its a super fun social
          activity but also extrememly relaxing. It’s a hobbie that I know im
          not the best at but always see improvement everytime I do it. It’s
          mostly an activity close to my heart that brings me satisfaction and
          peace of mind.

        <h4>Painting</h4>
        <p>
          I only took up painting because my sister is an artist and she found
          so much joy in drawing and art that I thought I could try to do it
          too. I love painitng abstract obejcts and people. My sister is also my
          biggest critique and supporter when it comes to art which personally I
          love. I’ve recently tried to paint simple form figures and landscapes.
          Its all about coming out of my comfort zone since im not really good
          at that but taking up painting as a hobbie has taught me that. This
          new hobbie of mine has taught me some pretty valuable lessons mostly
          revolving around my patience and happy mistakes.

        <h4>Reading Tarot Cards</h4>
        <p>
        Reading tarot cards is definitely my most recent hobbie. My neighbor had
        gotten me really into it during quaratine. I invested in my own deck and
        now give all my friends readings. The way it works is you ask a pretty
        broad question and then read the cards in the spots they are placed. I
        always read my cards in the form of a celtic cross where every position
        has a different way to read the card. For exmaple the first card down is
        that person in the present, theres a card laid on top and  thats their
        challenge theyre facing. One card on the back is the past, in front is
        the present, above is their strengths, below is subconcious and what its
        trying to tell you. On the side of that formation theres four cards.
        First is  your sugessted path, second what you need to know, third is
        hopes and fears and fourth is your outcome card. Now there are two types
        of cards: Major Arcana cards and Minor Arcana cards. Major arcana
        contain the sun, moon, fool, devil, and more. While the Minor Arcana
        contains 4 suits the wands, swords, pentacles, and cups with a 1 through
        10, queen, king, knight, and page in each suit. The wands represent your
        energy, motivation, passion, spirituality, and strengths. The swords are
        your thoughts, words, and actions. The pentacles are your finances,
        work, and material posessions. Finally the cups are your feelings,
        emotions, intuition, and creativity. Giving people readings makes me
        feel happy because it helps them understand situations they’re in or
        see it from another perspective.
